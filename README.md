This is a toy project where I tried training a neural network to
guess whether a set of Y-chromosome STR values from a DF27+ testee
is also Z196+.

To use it, you must have all 111 values, in the standard FTDNA order.
If the values are missing or not from a DF27+ testee, the results
will of course be meaningless.

Run it using Python 3.  Enter the values, and it will tell you what
it thinks.
